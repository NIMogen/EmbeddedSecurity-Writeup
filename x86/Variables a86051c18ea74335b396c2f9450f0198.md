# Variables

**How to spot a variable**

Variables can either be created on the stack (generally meaning they are a local variable), or they can be held at a constant memory address (global variables)

```c
// Hardcoded address
mov eax, [0xlonghexvalue]

// non-hardcoded (placed on the stack)
mov ecx, [esp + 4]
mov ecx, ebx
mov eax, ecx
```

**.bss and .data sections**

These hold variables that can change at runtime.
