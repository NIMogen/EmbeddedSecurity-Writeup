**Stack Frames**

Functions are generally allocated a *stack frame* that holds function parameters and function variables, and this allows a function to operate *as if* it were at the top of the stack.

Standard entry sequence, allowing local variables to be accessed via ebp

push ebp

mov ebp, esp

And space is allocated on the stack through

sub esp, n

Now, does this make it so that the stack pointer can be referenced through ebp, or does it make it so that the value currently at the stack pointer is copied into ebp?

```c
void func() {
	int a, b, c;
  a = 10;
	b = 5;
  c = 2;
  //...
}
/* Asm
push ebp  # Push ebp onto the stack
mov ebp, esp # Copy the stack pointer into ebp
sub esp, 12 # Allocate space on the stack for variables

mov [ebp - 4], 10
mov [ebp - 8], 5
mov [ebp - 12] 2

*/
```

**Standard Exit**

Space in the stack must be cleared and ebp must be returned to its prior value (the top of the stack), and the flow of execution must return to the point at which it was called

```c
void func(int x, int y, int z) {
	int a, b, c;
	return;
}
/*Asm
func:
push ebp
mov ebp, esp
sub esp, 12
mov esp, ebp
pop ebp
ret 12
*/
```
